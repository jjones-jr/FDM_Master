1. All points are set with initial concentrations corresponding to those presented in Anand(2003).
2. Functions for concentrations of AP,RP,APS,RP, all wall flux equations and deposition functions reference Sorensen, 
while source terms for the remaining 25 species were taken from Anand(2003). 
3. Reaction wall flux equations reference Sorensen(1998) and its derivative Fernolendt(2011).
